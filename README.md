4. Re-measure

### 📌 Data Structure / Approach Cheat-Sheet

| What hurts? | Key symptom | Grab this tool |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **I keep recounting / re-adding** | Sum/count items from A…B many times | Prefix sum, difference array, Fenwick/BIT, segment tree |
| **I only need a running best** | Min/max in the last k steps | Sliding-window + deque, monotonic stack |
| **I must pop the last thing pushed** | Undo / backtrack easily | Stack |
| **I visit items FIFO** | Process in arrival order | Queue, deque |
| **I need to jump to any index fast** | Random access in O(1) | Array / dynamic array |
| **Look-ups by key must be instant** | Is X present? What’s its count? | Hash set, hash map |
| **Keep items ordered and searchable** | Insert, delete, get <, =, > in log n | Balanced BST (AVL, Red-Black, Treap) |
| **Repeated look-ups in sorted stuff** | Lots of searches, data rarely mutates | Binary search, two-pointers |
| **Need the k-smallest / largest often** | Top-k or continuous median | Heap / priority queue |
| **Relationship is parent → children** | Hierarchy, folder tree, org chart | Tree |
| **Many-to-many roads/connections** | Find paths, cycles, clusters | Graph (adjacency list), BFS/DFS, Dijkstra, Union-Find |
| **Optimize yes/no choices** | Pick items for max profit under limit | Dynamic programming |
| **String pattern finding** | Search/compare lots of substrings | Rolling hash, Trie, KMP, Z-algo |
| **Massive reads, rare writes** | Query ranges on mostly static data | Sparse table, offline queries + Mo’s algorithm |
| **Data changes in blocks** | Add +5 to A…B often, query sometime | Lazy segment tree, difference array |
| **Need to stream + rewind** | Traverse forward/back without extra mem | Iterator, generator, linked list |
| **Memory tiny, data huge** | Trade speed for RAM | Bitset, Bloom filter |
| **Parallel splits easy** | Divide work into equal chunks | Divide & conquer, map-reduce style |

### 🧠 Mini decision flow

- Is data mostly READ-ONLY?
 └─Yes→ Is it sorted? → Binary search / two-pointers
      └─No→ Hash map or array index

- Need ORDER & fast updates?
 └─Yes→ Balanced BST  / heap  / segment tree

- Sliding window of size k?
 └─Use deque or two pointers

- Counting ranges repeatedly?
 └─Prefix sum → Fenwick → Segment tree (in that order)

- Graphy vibes?
 └─Unweighted paths → BFS
 └─Weighted → Dijkstra / Bellman-Ford
 └─Connectivity only → Union-Find

### 🚦 How to pick (2-step plan)

1. **Choose ONE primary resource** that matches your learning style (comic-book, animated site, or video).  
2. **Pair it with a practice arena** (LeetCode/HackerRank). After each new concept, solve 2-3 related problems immediately.

This mirrors *fastbook’s* “read → code → experiment” loop and keeps you from falling into pure-memorization mode. Happy learning!
